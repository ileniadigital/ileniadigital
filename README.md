I am a Computer Science Undergraduate student at Queen Mary University of London, with passion for creativity and technology. I aim to work in Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to develop simpler, more automatic and secure experiences for users, creating opportunities for more accessible experiences.
I enjoy designing and developing through a range of media - both physical and digital - software and languages. I have gained my skills and continue to improve them through experiences with organisations such as LDE UTC LEGO Innovation Lab, RE:CODE London, Institute of Imagination, Morgan Stanley, STYLY and more. 
I also enjoy reading a wide variety of books, writing, painting and boxing.
