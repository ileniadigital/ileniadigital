I am a passionate, resilient and creative Computer Science student, aiming to develop simpler, more accessible and secure experiences for users.
As an Amazon Future Engineer, I actively contribute to innovative projects, such as the eFitter's customer dashboard as part of my software engineering internship, and designing customised strategies for clients' social media profiles and websites.

Furthermore, I actively support students to achieve their aims in STEM, by contributing to LEGO Robotics sessions at London Design & Engineering UTC, at the Imperial Global Summer School, teaching programming to children and assisting younger university students as a demonstrator.

I also enjoy reading a wide variety of books, writing, painting and boxing.
